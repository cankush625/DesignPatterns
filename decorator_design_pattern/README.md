# Decorator Design Pattern

## Intent
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide
a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Also Known as
Wrapper

## When to use
- Use this pattern to attach additional responsibilities to an individual
  objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other
  objects.
- Use for responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
- Use when extension by subclassing is impossible.
