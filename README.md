3. [Singleton Design Pattern](./singleton_design_pattern)  
    - Use this pattern when there must be exactly one instance of a class, and 
    it must be accessible globally.
    - When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing it.

## Domain Driven Design Patterns

1. [Repository Design Pattern](./repository_design_pattern)  
    Repository design pattern is used for providing abstraction to the
    data access logic. Using Repository Design Pattern, the business logic
    layer of your application need not have any knowledge on how data 
    persistence happens beneath.
